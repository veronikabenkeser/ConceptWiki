{"name":"ConceptWiki","tagline":"","body":"<h1>ConceptWiki</h1>\r\nThis project was built as a part of Free Code Camp's Front-End Development curriculum.\r\n\r\n<h2>User Stories</h2>\r\n1. As a user, I can search Wikipedia entries and get a visual representation of the resulting Wikipedia entries.\r\n2. As a user, I will be able to see a range of concepts that relate to my initial search and explore their relationship to each other.\r\n3. As a user, I can click a button to generate a random Wikipedia entry.\r\n\r\n<h2>Interesting  bits</h2>\r\n1. Text is dynamically added to the correct Bootstrap carousel slide via a MutationObserver.\r\n2. JS files are loaded asynchronously via promises.\r\n3. Once Wikipedia generates a list of linked terms, the app searches Google to find an image that matches that term and displays it on the screen.\r\n4. Concept visualization is done via Cytoscape, an open-source platform for visualizing networks. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab236/Veronika_and_Robert/Screenshot%20from%202016-01-26%20071322_zpspp3vwkhy.png\" class=\"img-responsive\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab236/Veronika_and_Robert/Screenshot%20from%202016-01-26%20131320_zpsmdc8avu0.png\" class=\"img-responsive\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\r\nDesigned of the front page was inspired by www.instactables.com .\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
